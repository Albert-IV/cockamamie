Intended to be a launchpad for my weird ergogen-based keyboards I guess?

Right now I'm iterating on a yet-unnamed split that takes the splay from the Absolem keyboard and the lowered thumb keys of the Draculad.  PCB's are off to JLC and further iterations will be coming depending on how I like the feel.
